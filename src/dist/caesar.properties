### List of processes ###

# A process is described by:
# process.<id> = <address>:<port for replicas>
process.0=localhost:2021
process.1=localhost:2022
process.2=localhost:2023

### System model ###
ProposerMapSize=1000000
NumThreads=2

ZmqHost=localhost
ZmqPort=5558
# Failure detector
RecoveryLeader=0
# How long to wait until suspecting the leader.
#Default: 1000
FDSuspectTimeout = 1000
# Interval between sending heartbeats.
# Default: 500
FDSendTimeout = 500

### Concurrency and optimization setup ###

# Maximum size of batches.
# Default: 65507
#
# The leader will try to batch requests in a single proposal to improve performance.
# This setting controls how big the batches can be before having to be sent.
# This value may be exceeded if a request is larger than the BatchSize.
BatchSize = 65507

# Maximum time a batch may be delayed starting from the time the first
# request is added to it.
# Default: 10
#
# A batch is sent either when it's full (reaches BatchSize) or this delay elapses.
MaxBatchDelay = 10


### Networking section ###

# Main protocol used to communicate between replicas. Options:
#  - TCP
#  - UDP
#  - Generic - Uses UDP for small (<64KB) messages and TCP for larger messages
# Default: TCP
Network = TCP

# Threshold used by GenericNetwork to send packets using
# UDP (size<=MaxUDPPacketSize) or TCP (size>MaxUDPPacketSize).
# Default: 65507
MaxUDPPacketSize = 65507

# Initial time of message retransmission
# Default: 1000
RetransmitTimeoutMilisecs = 1000

# If a TCP connection fails, how much to wait for another try
# Default: 1000
TcpReconnectMilisecs = 1000
